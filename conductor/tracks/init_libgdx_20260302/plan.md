# Implementation Plan - Initialize libGDX project structure and core game loop

This plan outlines the steps to set up the initial libGDX project and a basic game loop.

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding
- [x] Task: Initialize Gradle project with core and desktop modules (896a30a)
    - [ ] Create root uild.gradle and settings.gradle
    - [x] Configure Java 20 toolchain and libGDX dependencies
- [x] Task: Implement basic DesktopLauncher (c761833)
    - [x] Create DesktopLauncher class in the desktop module
    - [x] Configure Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration (window title, size, etc.)
- [x] Task: Implement core Game class (c761833)
    - [x] Create PathPuzzleGame class extending Game in the core module
    - [ ] Implement create(), 
ender(), and dispose() methods with basic screen clearing
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Project Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Environment Verification
- [ ] Task: Verify build and execution
    - [ ] Run ./gradlew desktop:run and confirm the game window appears
    - [ ] Verify the render loop clears the screen with the expected color
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Environment Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
