    - [ ] Create `MenuScreen` class implementing libGDX's `Screen`.
    - [ ] Define the `AssetManager` for loading textures and audio.
    - [ ] Write unit tests to verify `MenuScreen` initialization and stage setup.
    - [ ] Implement `MenuScreen` skeleton to pass initial tests.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Preparation & Setup' (e0b2df0)

## Phase 2: UI Layout & Graphics [checkpoint: 08d61eb]
- [x] Task: Background & Logo Rendering (1a27cf5)
    - [ ] Write tests for background image loading and rendering in `MenuScreen`.
    - [ ] Implement background image display using a `Texture` or `TextureRegion`.
    - [ ] Write tests for logo placement within the UI table.
    - [ ] Implement logo rendering at the top of the button panel.
- [x] Task: Button Panel Layout (78de155)
    - [ ] Write tests for UI `Table` alignment (aligned to the right side of the screen).
    - [ ] Write tests for button creation and vertical organization in the `Table`.
    - [ ] Implement the `Table` and buttons ("Start", "Options", "Exit") to pass tests.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: UI Layout & Graphics' (08d61eb)

## Phase 3: Interactivity & Transitions
- [ ] Task: Screen Transitions
    - [ ] Write tests to verify that clicking the "Start" button transitions the game to `GameScreen`.
    - [ ] Implement the `ClickListener` for the "Start" button.
- [ ] Task: Application Control
    - [ ] Write tests to verify that clicking the "Exit" button triggers `Gdx.app.exit()`.
    - [ ] Implement the `ClickListener` for the "Exit" button.
- [ ] Task: Options Placeholder
    - [ ] Implement a basic placeholder for the "Options" button (e.g., logging a message).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Interactivity & Transitions' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Audio & Polish
- [ ] Task: Background Music
    - [ ] Write tests for loading and playback of background music.
    - [ ] Implement looping background music in `MenuScreen`.
- [ ] Task: Sound Effects (SFX)
