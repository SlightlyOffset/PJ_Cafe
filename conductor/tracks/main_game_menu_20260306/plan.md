- [ ] Task: Options Placeholder
    - [ ] Implement a basic placeholder for the "Options" button (e.g., logging a message).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Interactivity & Transitions' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Audio & Polish
- [ ] Task: Background Music
    - [ ] Write tests for loading and playback of background music.
    - [ ] Implement looping background music in `MenuScreen`.
